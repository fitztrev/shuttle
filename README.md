![How Shuttle works](https://raw.github.com/fitztrev/shuttle/gh-pages/img/how-shuttle-works.gif)

**Sidenote**: *Many people ask, so here's how I have [my terminal setup](https://github.com/fitztrev/shuttle/wiki/My-Terminal-Prompt).*

## Installation

1. Download [Shuttle](http://fitztrev.github.io/shuttle/)
2. Copy to Applications

## JSON Path Change

In your home directory create a file called ```~/.shuttle.path```
In this file should be a single line with the path to the JSON settings file. 

```
/Users/thshdw/Dropbox/shuttle/shuttle.json
``` 
shuttle will read ```~/.shuttle.path``` first and use its contents as the path to your JSON file.

## JSON Options
### Global settings
#### ```"editor": "VALUE",```
_This changes the app that opens settings.json for editing (Global Setting)_

Possible values are ```default```, ```nano```, ```vi```, ```vim``` or any terminal based editor. 
```default``` opens settings.json in whatever app is registered as the default for extension ```.json```
```
"editor": "vim",
``` 
would open ```~/.shuttle.json``` in vim

----

#### ```"launch_at_login": VALUE,```
_This allows you to flag the shuttle.app to start automatically (Global Setting)_

Possible values are ```true``` or ```false```

----

#### ```"terminal": "VALUE",```
_This allows you to set the default terminal (Global Setting)_

Possible values are ```Terminal.app``` or ```iTerm```.

----

#### ```"iTerm_version": "VALUE",```
_This changes the applescripts for iTerm (Global Setting)_

Possible values are ```stable``` or ```nightly```

**If ```terminal``` is set to ```iTerm``` this setting is mandatory**

_This setting is ignored if your terminal is set to ```Terminal.app```_

----

#### ```"default_theme": "Homebrew",```
_This sets the Terminal theme for all windows. (Global Setting)_ 

Possible values are the Profile names in your terminal preferences. iTerm ships with one Profile named "Default". OS X Terminal ships with several. To see the names see the preferences area of the terminal you are using.

In iTerm the profile names are case sensitive.

**Please ensure the theme names you set are valid. If shuttle passes theme "Dagobah" and it does not exist in iTerm or OS X Terminal then your command won't run. This is because the applescripts are not making any checks to see if the theme you passed actually exists within the terminal application.** 

This setting can be overwritten by the command level ```"theme"``` settings

----

#### ```"open_in": "VALUE",```
_This changes the default action for how commands are opened (Global Setting)_

Possible values are ```tab``` or ```new```. 

```tab``` opens the command in the active terminal in a new tab. 

```new``` opens the command in a new window. 

This setting can be overwritten by the command level ```"inTerminal"``` settings

----

#### ```"show_ssh_config_hosts": VALUE,```
_This changes parsing ssh config. By default, Shuttle will parse your ```~/.ssh/config``` file for hosts. (Global Setting)_

Possible values are ```false``` or ```true```

----

#### ```"ssh_config_ignore_hosts": ["VALUE", "VALUE"],```
_This will ignore hosts in the ssh config. (Global Setting)_

Possible values are the hosts in your config that you want to ignore. If you had github.com and git.example.com in your ssh config, to ignore them you set:

```"ssh_config_ignore_hosts": ["github.com", "git.example.com"],```

----

#### ```"ssh_config_ignore_keywords": ["VALUE"],```
_This will ignore keywords in your ssh config. (Global Setting)_

Possible values are the keywords in your ssh config that you want to ignore.

----

**Additional ssh config customization** 
#### Nested menus for `~/.ssh/config` hosts

##### Create a menu item at "work" > "servers" > "web01"

```
Host work/servers/web01
        HostName user@web01.example.com
```
\- *or* -

```
Host gandalf
        # shuttle.name = work/servers/web01 (webserver)
        HostName user@web01.example.com
```

### Command level settings
_Command level settings are unique to your command and will overwrite the Global setting equivalent_

#### ```"cmd": "VALUE"```
_This is the command / script that will be launched in the terminal. (Command setting)_

Where Value is a command or script. 
```
"cmd": "ps aux | grep [s]sh"
```
Would check for ssh processes.

----

#### ```"name": "VALUE"```
_This sets the text that will appear in shuttles drop down menu. (Command setting)_

Were Value is the text you want to see in the drop down menu for this command. 
```
"name": "SSH to my wordpress blog"
```

This value can also set the title of the terminal window if ```"title" :"VALUE"``` is not set.

----

#### ```"inTerminal": "VALUE",```
_This sets how command will open in the terminal window. (Command setting)_

Possible values are ```new```, ```tab```, or ```current```

```new``` opens the command in a new terminal window. 

```tab``` opens the command in the active terminal window in a new tab. 

```current``` opens the command in the active terminal's window. 

When using using ```current``` I recommend that you wrap the command in some user input like this:

```
echo "are you sure y/n"; read sure; if [ "$sure" == "y" ]; then echo "running command" && ps aux | grep [s]sh; else echo "exiting..."; fi
```

Do this as a precaution as it could be possible to run a command on the wrong host. 

```none``` the command will be executed in background, by running a subprocess.

When using using ```none``` you can interact with script. You can only get output inside an alert panel.

----

#### ```"theme": "VALUE",```
_This sets the theme for the terminal window. (Command setting)_

Possible values are the profile names for iTerm or OS X Terminal.

If ```"theme"``` is not set and ```"default_theme"``` is not set then shuttle passes Profile ```Default``` for iTerm and Profile ```basic``` for OS X terminal.

----

#### ```"title": "VALUE"```
_This sets the text that will appear in the terminal's title bar. (Command setting)_

Where VALUE is the text you want to set in the terminals title bar. 

If ```title``` is missing shuttle uses the menu's name and sets this as ```title```

## Roadmap

* Cloud hosting integration
  * AWS, Rackspace, Digital Ocean, etc
  * Using their APIs, automatically add all of your machines to the menu
* Preferences panel for easier configuration
* Update notifications
* Keyboard hotkeys
  * Open menu
  * Select host option within menu

## Credits

Shuttle was inspired by [SSHMenu](http://sshmenu.sourceforge.net/), the GNOME applet for Linux.

I also looked to projects such as [MLBMenu](https://github.com/markolson/MLB-Menu) and [QuickSmileText](https://github.com/scturtle/QuickSmileText) for direction on building a Cocoa app for the status bar.
